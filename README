ROI Constraint UNIT

Baseline Method:
UNIT: UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation Networks
GitHub repo: https://github.com/mingyuliutw/UNIT
Paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00848

Organization of Codes:
- The original UNIT:
    - datasets
        Directory for different kinds of image loaders, defined in the original UNIT
    - tools
        Directory for training configuration loading, defined in the original UNIT
    - trainers
        Directory for the implementation of different netwokrs, generators, discriminators and encoders
    - cocogan_train_domain_adaptation.py
        Training scirpt for implementing domain adaptation
    - cocogan_translate_one_image.py
        Inference script for translating one image to the other domain
    - cocogan_translate.py
        Inference script for translating all images from image loader to the other domain
    - common.py
        A helper script for training utilization 

- My improvement:
    - cocogan_train_roi.py
        Training script of ROI (Region of Interest) Constraint UNIT. I basically add a ROI generator and discriminator to enforce cycle consistency to the cropped image domains.
    - trainers/cocgan_trainer.py
        A script for implementing the weight update operation of generators and discriminators. I modified the weight update function to adapt to our needs.
    - run_same_image_for_iterations.py
        A script to generate image translation results for multiple generators
    - run_same_net_for_images.py
        A script to generate multiple image translation results using a specific generator
